            This is an analysis of the perception and attitude of Kenyans, in Nairobi,
            on the novel Coronavirus.
            This analysis covers the period February - August 2020.

            Sentiment analysis models focus on polarity (positive, negative, neutral)
            but also on feelings and emotions (angry, happy, sad, etc),
            urgency (urgent,not urgent) and even intentions (interested v. not interested).

            Sentiment analysis algorithms fall into one of three buckets:
            * **Rule-based:** these systems automatically perform sentiment analysis based
            on a set of manually crafted rules.
            * **Automatic:** systems rely on machine learning techniques to learn from data.
            * **Hybrid systems:** combine both rule-based and automatic approaches.
